DLC2Action is an actively developed package and we welcome community development and involvement.

We are happy to receive code extensions, bug fixes, documentation updates, etc.

## Setting up a development installation
In order to make changes to `DLC2Action`, you will need to [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork) the
[repository](https://github.com/amathislab/dlc2action).

- DOCSTRING update for your change
- A working example of how it works for users.
- If it's a function that also can be used in downstream steps (i.e. could be plotted) we ask you (1) highlight this, and (2) ideally you provide that functionality as well.

**Review & Formatting:**

- Please run black on the code to conform to our Black code style (see more at https://pypi.org/project/black/).
