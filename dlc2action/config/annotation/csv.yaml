behaviors: null # set; the behaviors to predict (if null, if will be inferred from the data; !!PLEASE SET IT MANUALLY if different files can have different behavior sets!!)
correction: null # dict; a dictionary of label corrections (e. g. {'sleping': 'sleeping', 'calm locomotion': 'locomotion'}
error_class: null # str; a class denoting errors in the pose estimation (the intervals annotated with this class will be ignored)
min_frames_action: 5 # int; the minimum number of frames for an action (shorter actions will be discarded during training)
filter_annotated: false # bool; discard long unannotated intervals during training
filter_background: false # bool; only label frames as background if a behavior is annotated somewhere close
filter_visibility: false # bool; only label behaviors if there is suffucient visibility
visibility_min_score: 0 # float; the minimum visibility score for visibility filtering
visibility_min_frac: 0 # float; the minimum fraction of visible frames for visibility filtering
annotation_suffix: ??? # str | set, optional the suffix or the set of suffices such that the annotation files are named {video_id}{annotation_suffix}, e.g, video1_suffix.pickle where video1 is the video id and _suffix.pickle is the suffix
use_hard_negatives : false # bool, mark hard negatives as 2 instead of 0 or 1, for loss functions that have options for hard negative processing
separator: "," # str; separator in the csv file
fps: 1 # int; fps (assuming the annotations are given in seconds, otherwise set 1)
