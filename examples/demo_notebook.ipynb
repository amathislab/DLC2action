    "Searches in `DLC2Action` use the `optuna` auto-ML package to sample the hyperpameter space efficiently and save time on trials that go badly from the beginning. \n",

    "There are two methods for running a search: `project.run_hyperparameter_search()` and `project.run_default_hyperparameter_search()`. As you might have guessed from the names, the second method will just load the default set of parameters for a given model while the first allows you to optimize whatever you want. For the vast majority of cases `project.run_default_hyperparameter_search()` should be enough, so that is what we will use in thi tutorial."
